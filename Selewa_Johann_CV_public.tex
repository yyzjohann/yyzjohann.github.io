%%% Skills
%%% ------------------------------------------------------------
\NewPart{Computer Science}{}

Between 2018 and 2020 I took computer science courses, beside studying for my degree in mathematics and working at the university. I completed the following, all at KTH:  Two courses in algorithms and complexity (of which one on advanced level),  an advanced level course each in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and an advanced level course in cryptography.

I have also completed the lab exercises in one advanced level course each for computer security, and software safety and security (both at KTH).

\NewPart{Software}{}

Below I list the software and computer languages I have worked with enough to be comfortable with.

Python, Java, Haskell, Prolog, Latex, Bash/Zsh, Lisp (scheme and e-lisp), Javascript (including node.js and json), HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, C/C++, Git.

\NewPart{Repositories}

I keep a private BitBucket account where I keep all my working projects. Because of infringement concerns, I publish my finished projects as password protected zip files on my public GitHub profile (see link above, or \href{https://github.com/yyzjohann}{here}). The password is not included in this public version of my CV.


\NewPart{Languages}{}

I am studying my second semester of russian (45 finished credits), and have studied half a semester (15 credits) of french at Stockholm University. I studied spanish through ninth grade and high school.

\SkillsEntry{}{Maternal or fluent: Swedish, English, (East) Assyrian}
