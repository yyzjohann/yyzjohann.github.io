      <h3>TLDR: </h3>
      The automorphism group of an abstract simplicial complex \(\Delta\) acts on various objects associated to the Stanley-Reisner ring \(R\) of \(\Delta\), for example its Betti polynomial. Understand this action in terms of the combinatorics and homology of \(\Delta\). <!-- Because it is a bit clunky to write math in HTML, you can see <a href="main.pdf" download="main.pdf">this abomination of a bacholor thesis</a> for more details (especially section 5 and onward), but please avoid it if you can. -->

      <h4> Introduction. </h4>
      <p>
        Let \(n > 0\) be an integer, and \(\Delta\) an abstract simplicial complex on a vertex set on (or indexed by) \([n] = \{1, ..., n\}\). Let \(k\) be a field (of characteristic zero, say) and let \(M = R_\Delta\) be the finitely generated monomial \(k\)-algebra generated by the vertices of \(\Delta\), subject to a set of monomial relations which we will define. That is, \(M = S/I\), where \(S = k[x_1, ..., x_n]\), and \(I = I_\Delta\) is to be defined. We routinely identify the vertex \(i\) with the variable \(x_i\).</p>


      <h4> Definitions. </h4>
      <p>Let \(\{i_1, ...,i_r\}\) be a simplex in \(\Delta\). We identify it with the product \(x_{i_1}\cdot ... \cdot x_{i_r} \in k[x_1, ..., x_n]\). Then let \(I_\Delta\) be the ideal of \(S\) generated by all products \(\prod_{i \in J} x_i\), ranging over all non-simplexes \(J\) of \(\Delta\). By this we mean that \(J\) is a set of vertices, which if included in \(\Delta\), would form a simplex. Then \(I_\Delta\) is a squarefree monomial ideal. The quotient \(S/I_\Delta\) is the Stanley-Reisner ring associated to the abstract simplicial complex \(\Delta\). </p>

      <h4> Example. </h4>
      <p>Let \(\Delta\) be the Scarf complex naturally on \( [4]\). Then \(I_\Delta = (x_1x_4, x_2x_4)\), since the only simplexes (in this case edges) missing are the ones connecting the triangle to the lone edge sticking out of the triangle.</p>

      <br>

      <p>The Stanley-Reisner ring \(R_\Delta\) is a graded module over the graded ring \(S\), of the form \(\oplus_{a \in \mathbf{N}^n} R_a\), both considered with the standard \(\mathbf{N}^n\)-grading. As such it has a Hilbert-Poincaré series.</p>


      <h4> Theorem. </h4>
      <p>Let \(\Delta\) be an abstract simplicial complex, and \(R\) its Stanley-Reisner ring. The multi-graded Hilbert-Poincaré series \(HP(R) = HP(R; x_1, ..., x_n)\) of \(R\) is equal to
      $$ \sum_{a \in \mathbf{N}^n} \dim_k(R_a) = \sum_{\sigma \in \Delta} \prod_{i \in \sigma} \frac{x_i}{1-x_i} = \frac{\sum_{\sigma \in \Delta}\prod_{i \in \sigma} x_i \prod_{i \notin \sigma} (1-x_i)}{\prod_{i = 1}^n (1-x_i)}.$$
        The left hand side is the main result, where the right hand side is just written on the least common denominator. A proof may be found in Miller-Sturmfels.
      </p>

      <br>


      <h4> Some homology. </h4>
      
      <p> It is a general fact that when \(I\) is generated by forms, say of degrees \(d_1, ..., d_r\), then
        $$HS(I,x_1, ..., x_n) =  \frac{p(x_1, ..., x_n)}{\prod_{i=1}^n(1 - x_i^{d_i})},$$
        for some polynomial \(p \in S\). This polynomial is called the Betti polynomial, for the following reason: By the syzygy theorem, any \(S\)-module \(N\) has a free resolution of length at most \(n\). Let
        $$F_\bullet = 0 \to F_n \to ... \to F_1 \to N \to 0$$        
        be a <i>minimal</i> such resolution (augmented with \(N\) here). In particular this means that the Betti numbers of \(N\) are well-defined. Since we work with the standard multi-grading, each \(F_i\) is a finite direct sum of the form
        $$\oplus_{a \in \mathbf{N}^n} S(a)^{\beta_{i, a}}.$$
        Here \(a = (a_1,...,a_n)\) denotes a multi-index, \(S(a)\) the subsequent shift, and \(S(a)^{\beta_{i, a}}\) the direct sum of \(\beta_{i, a}\) many copies of \(S(a)\). It is easy to see that
        $$HS(S(a)^{\beta_{i, a}}) = \beta_{i, a} x^a HS(S),$$
        where \(x^a = \prod_i x_i^{a_i}\). It follows that \(HS(N)/HS(S)\) is a polynomial, whose coefficients are the Betti numbers of \(N\). 
      </p>

      <p> In our case \(I\) is generated by squarefree monomials, and \(N = M = R/I\).</p>
      
      <h4> Some combinatorics. </h4>

      To \(\Delta\) we associate its automorphism group \(\operatorname{aut}(\Delta)\). Then \(\operatorname{aut}(\Delta)\) acts naturally on \(S\) and \(R\). Let \(K\) be a set of vertexes of \(\Delta\), and denote by \(\operatorname{orb}(K)\) its orbit under the action of \(\operatorname{aut}(\Delta).\) Let \(x^K = \prod_{i \in K} x_i\) be the mononmial associated to \(K\). Define
      $$s_K = \sum_{L \in \operatorname{orb}(K)}x^L$$
      as the <i>(elementary) graph-symmetric polynomial</i> associated to \(K\). Clearly \(s_K = s_L\) whenever \(K,L\) lie in the same orbit.

      <h4> Example (to explain the name). </h4>

      Let \(\Delta\) be a graph on a \([n]\) (in the ordinary sense), and note that it is also an abstract simplicial complex by viewing the edges as the simplices. If \(\Delta = K_n\), the complete graph on \(n\) vertices, then \(\operatorname{aut}(\Delta) = S_n\), the symmetric group on \(n\) letters, and the elementary graph-symmetric polynomials are exactly the elementary symmetric polynomials. 


      <h4> The main thing.</h4>

      An automorphism of \(g\) \(\Delta\) is at the heart a bijection, or permutation, of the vertexes which preserves further structure. Viewing monomials \(x^a\) as their supporting index sets \(\mathrm{supp}(x^a) = \{i \mid a_i \neq 0\}\), equivalently as sets of vertexes of \(\Delta\) induces an action of \(g\) on the Betti polynomial and Betti numbers, and the associated minimal free resolution of \(M\). We ask
      
      <ol start=0>
        <li> First of all, is any of this (see questions below) already explored in the literature? Does it have any meaning, or leads anywhere at all, or is it a trivial or uninteresting, maybe even false/incorrect matter?
        <li>What are some/the connections between the homology and the combinatorics of \(\Delta\) through this action?</li>
        <li> What are some/the properties of this action, in terms of the properties of \(M\) or \(\Delta\)?</li>
        <li> Investigate the properties of the graph-symmetric polyonmials. What can be said when the Betti polyonmial written in terms of the graph-symmetric polynomials? What can be said in general about this kind of symmetry on polynomials?  </li>
        <li> Let \(G\) be a graph, and consider the clique and independence complexes of \(G\). Given answers to the above questions for these complexes, what are some/the connections/properties to the action of the same complexes for the line graph \(L(G)\)? That is, given answers to the former set of complexes, how are they connected to the latter? </li>
        <li> Generalise the previous question to other complexes on (finite) graphs: what are some relations between a complex on \(G\) and the same complex on \(L(G)\), through this action?</li>        
      </ol>

      Questions 5 and 6 were originally proposed by Jörgen Backelin, possibly together with Rikard Bøgvad, and mainly concerned comparing the homology of the Stanley-Reisner rings of the clique and independence complexes of \(G\) and \(L(G)\), to find some connections between the two. These are also interesting questions, and we ask the same questions about the action of \(\operatorname{aut}(\Delta)\).


      <h4> A example. </h4>
      <p>As an example of the first question, we show that the action of \(\operatorname{aut}(\Delta)\) preserves homological degree, in the following sense: Let \(\beta_{i,a}\)be a Betti number of \(M\), and let \(g\) be an automorphism of \(\Delta\). If \(g(\beta_{i,a}) = \beta_{j, b}\) then necessarily \(i=j\). In fact it is enough that it permutes the vertices and nothing more.  Also note that \(g\) acts as \(g(\beta_{i,a}) = \beta_{i,g(a)}\).</p>

      <h4>"Proof".</h4>
        The maps in the minimal free resolution \(F\) are degree-preserving, and the minimality of \(F\) forces the differential matrices to consist of non-invertible elements of \(S\), at least when they are non-zero. That is, they act component-wise as multiplication by polynomials (here monomials). Thus the multi-degrees by which the generators are shifted must be higher in homological degree \(i\) than in \(i-1\). Viewing the multi-degrees as vertex sets of \(\Delta\), and using that a bijection preserves sizes of sets of vertexes, gives that \(g\) only permutes direct sums within the same homological degree of \(F_\bullet\).</p>

      

      <p>
        Note that, since everything is square-free, we have that the size of a vertex set is equal to the total size of the multi-index it defines; that is, if \(K\) is a set of vertexes of \(\Delta\) then let \(a_j = 1\) if \(j \in K\), and \(0\) otherwise, and let \(a = (a_1, ..., a_n)\). Then \(\operatorname{\texttt{#}} K = |a| = \sum a_i\). This is used in the last step above.
      </p>

      <p> We might ask if the reverse is true: given a Betti number \(\beta_{i,a}\) and a \(\Delta\)-automorphism \(g\), is there some multi-index \(b\) (with corresponding Betti number \(\beta_{i, b}\) such that \(g(\beta_{i,a}) = \beta_{i,b}\)? Or: given \(\beta_{i,a}\), does there exist any \(g\) such that \(g(\beta_{i,a}) = \beta_{i,b}\) for some \(b\)?

        <h4>Further question.</h4>
      <p>
        Above we only used that \(g\) is a bijection. How can we further involve the simplicial structure it preserves, and what information can be gathered?
      </p>
