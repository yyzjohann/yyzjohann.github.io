        <h2>More precisely, a problem concerning Stanley-Reisner rings and their homology.</h2>


        
      </div>

      <h3>TLDR: </h3>
      The automorphism group of an abstract simplicial complex \(\Delta\) acts on the Betti polynomial of \(\Delta\). Understand this action in terms of the combinatorics and homology of \(\Delta\). Because it is a bit clunky to write math in HTML, you can see <a href="main.pdf" download="main.pdf">this abomination of a bacholor thesis</a> for more details (especially section 5 and onward), but please avoid it if you can.

      <h3> Introduction </h3>
      <p>
        Let \(n > 0\) be an integer, and \(\Delta\) an abstract simplicial complex on a vertex set indexed by \([n] = \{1, ..., n\}\). Let \(k\) be a field (of characteristic zero, say) and let \(M = R_\Delta\) be the finitely generated monomial \(k\)-algebra generated by the vertices of \(\Delta\), subject to a set of monomial relations which we will define. That is, \(M = S/I\), where \(S = k[x_1, ..., x_n]\), and \(I = I_\Delta\) is to be defined. </p>


      <h4> Definitions </h4>
      <p>Let \(\{x_{i_1}, ...,x_{i_r}\}\) be a simplex in \(\Delta\). We identify it with the product \(x_{i_1}\cdot ... \cdot x_{i_r} \in k[x_1, ..., x_n]\). Then let \(I_\Delta\) be the ideal of \(S\) generated by all products \(\prod_{i \in J} x_i\), ranging over all non-simplexes \(J\) of \(\Delta\). This is a squarefree monomial ideal. The quotient \(S/I_\Delta\) is the Stanley-Reisner ring associated to the abstract simplicial complex \(\Delta\). </p>

      <h4> Example </h4>
      <p>Let \(\Delta\) be the Scarf complex naturally on \(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\). Then \(I_\Delta = (x_1x_4, x_2x_4)\), since the only simplexes (in this case edges) missing are the ones connecting the triangle to the lone edge sticking out of the triangle.</p>

      <br>

      <p>The Stanley-Reisner ring \(R_\Delta\) is naturally a graded module over the graded ring \(S\), both considered with the standard \(\mathbf{N}^n\)-grading, and as such it has a Hilbert-Poincaré series.</p>


      <h4> Theorem </h4>
      <p>Let \(\Delta\) be an abstract simplicial complex as above, and \(R\) its Stanley-Reisner ring. The Hilbert-Poincaré series \(HS(M) = HS(M; x_1, ..., x_n)\) of \(R\) is equal to
      $$ \sum_{\sigma \in \Delta} \prod_{i \in \sigma} \frac{x_i}{1-x_i} = \frac{\sum_{\sigma \in \Delta}\prod_{i \in \sigma} x_i \prod_{i \notin \sigma} (1-x_i)}{\prod_{i = 1}^n (1-x_i)}$$
        The proof is not difficult, and is not given here.
      </p>

      <br>


      <h4> Some homology </h4>
      
      <p> It is a general fact that when \(I\) is generated by forms, say of degrees \(d_1, ..., d_r\), then
        $$HS(I,x_1, ..., x_n) =  \frac{p(x_1, ..., x_n)}{\prod_{i=1}^n(1 - x_i^{d_i})},$$
        for some polynomial \(p \in S\). This polynomial is called the Betti polynomial, for the following reason: By the syzygy theorem, any \(S\)-module \(N\) has a free resolution of length at most \(n\). Let
        $$F_\bullet = 0 \to F_n \to ... \to F_1 \to \to N \to 0$$        
        be such a resolution (augmented with \(N\) here). Since we work with the standard multi-grading, each \(F_i\) is a finite direct sum of the form
        $$\oplus_{a \in \mathbf{N}^n} S(a)^{\beta_{i, a}}.$$
        Here \(a = (a_1,...,a_n)\) denotes a multi-index, and \(S(a)\) the subsequent shift. It is easy to see that
        $$HS(S(a))^{\beta_{i, a}} = \beta_{i, a} x^a HS(S),$$
        where \(x^a = \prod_i x_i^{a_i}\). It follows that \(HS(N)/HS(S)\) is the Betti polynomial, whose coefficients are the Betti numbers of \(N\). 
      </p>

      <p> In our case \(I\) is generated by squarefree monomials, and \(N = M = R/I\).</p>
      
      <h4> Some combinatorics</h4>

      To \(\Delta\) we associate its automorphism group \(\operatorname{aut}(\Delta)\). Then \(\operatorname{aut}(\Delta)\) acts naturally on \(S\) and \(R\). Let \(K\) be a set of vertexes of \(\Delta\), and denote by \(\operatorname{orb}(K)\) its orbit under the action of \(\operatorname{aut}(\Delta).\) Let \(x^K = \prod_{i \in K} x_i\) be the mononmial associated to \(K\). Define
      $$s_K = \sum_{L \in \operatorname{orb}(K)}x^L$$
      as the <i>(elementary) graph-symmetric polynomial</i> associated to \(K\). Clearly \(s_K = s_L\) whenever \(K,L\) lie in the same orbit.

      <h4> Example (to explain the name)</h4>

      Let \(\Delta\) be a graph on a \([n]\) (in the ordinary sense), and note that it is also an abstract simplicial complex by viewing the edges as the simplices. If \(\Delta = K_n\), the complete graph on \(n\) vertices, then \(\operatorname{aut}(\Delta) = S_n\), the symmetric group on \(n\) letters, and the elementary graph-symmetric polynomials are exactly the elementary symmetric polynomials. 


      <h4> The main thing</h4>

      An automorphism of \(g\) \(\Delta\) is at the heart a bijection of the vertexes which preserves further structure. Viewing monomials \(x^a\) as their supporting index sets \(supp(x^a) = \{i \mid a_i \neq 0\}\), equivalently as sets of vertexes of \(\Delta\) induces an action of \(g\) on the Betti polynomial and Betti numbers, and the associated minimal free resolution of \(M\). We ask
      
      <ol>
        <li>What are some connections between the homology and the combinatorics of \(\Delta\) through this action?</li>
        <li> What are some properties of this action, in terms of the properties of \(M\) or \(\Delta\)?</li>
        <li> Let \(G\) be a graph, and consider the clique and independence complexes of \(G\). Given answers to the above questions for these complexes, what are some connections/properties to the action of the same complexes for the line graph \(L(G)\)?
          <li> Generalise the previous question to other complexes on graphs: what are some relations between a complex on \(G\) and the same complex on \(L(G)\), through this action?        
      </ol>


      <h4> A proposition </h4>
      As an example of the first question, it is easy to see that the action of \(\operatorname{aut}(\Delta)\) preserves homological degree, in the following sense: Let \(\beta_{i,a}\)be a Betti number of \(M\), and let \(g\) be an automorphism of \(\Delta\).  If \(g(\beta_{i,a}) = \beta_{j, b}\) then necessarily \(i=j\). This is because the maps in the minimal free resolution \(F\) are degree-preserving, and the minimality of \(F\) forces the differential matrices to consist of non-invertible elements of \(S\), i.e. they act component-wise as multiplication by polynomials (here monomials). Thus the shifted multi-degrees must be higher in homological degree \(i\) than in degree \(i-1\). Viewing the multi-degree as vertex sets of \(\Delta\), and using that an automorphism cannot send a set of vertexes to a larger or smaller set of vertexes, gives that \(g\) only permutes direct sums within the same homological degree of \(F_\bullet\).
